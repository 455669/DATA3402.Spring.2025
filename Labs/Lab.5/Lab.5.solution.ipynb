    "Matrix Representation: In this lab you will be creating a simple linear algebra system. In memory, we will represent matrices as nested python lists as we have done in lecture. In the exercises below, you are required to explicitly test every feature you implement, demonstrating it works.\n",

    "1. Create a `matrix` class with the following properties:\n",
    "    * It can be initialized in 2 ways:\n",
    "        1. with arguments `n` and `m`, the size of the matrix. A newly instanciated matrix will contain all zeros.\n",
    "        2. with a list of lists of values. Note that since we are using lists of lists to implement matrices, it is possible that not all rows have the same number of columns. Test explicitly that the matrix is properly specified.\n",
    "    * Matrix instances `M` can be indexed with `M[i][j]` and `M[i,j]`.\n",
    "    * Matrix assignment works in 2 ways:\n",
    "        1. If `M_1` and `M_2` are `matrix` instances `M_1=M_2` sets the values of `M_1` to those of `M_2`, if they are the same size. Error otherwise.\n",

    "    * `shape()`: returns a tuple `(n,m)` of the shape of the matrix.\n",
    "    * `transpose()`: returns a new matrix instance which is the transpose of the matrix.\n",
    "    * `row(n)` and `column(n)`: that return the nth row or column of the matrix M as a new appropriately shaped matrix object.\n",
    "    * `to_list()`: which returns the matrix as a list of lists.\n",
    "    *  `block(n_0,n_1,m_0,m_1)` that returns a smaller matrix located at the n_0 to n_1 columns and m_0 to m_1 rows. \n",

    "    * `M.add(N)`: adds two matrices $M$ and $N$. Donâ€™t forget to test that the sizes of the matrices are compatible for this and all other operations.\n",
    "    * `M.sub(N)`: subtracts two matrices $M$ and $N$.\n",
